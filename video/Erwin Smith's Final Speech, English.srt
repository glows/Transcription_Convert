1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,139
 There's no point standing around. We'll only be showered by more boulders.

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,339
 Ready your horses on the double!

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,000
 Be honest. Are all of us...

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,179
 riding to our deaths?

5
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:14,460
 Yes, we are.

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,000
 And since we're dying anyway, you're saying that it's better...

7
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,379
 if we at least die fighting?

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:22,920
 I am.

9
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:28,199
 But wait. If we'll die anyway, then who cares what we do?

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,379
 We could just disobey your orders.

11
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,659
 And it wouldn't mean a thing, would it?

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,700
 Yes, you're precisely right.

13
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:37,880
 Everything that you thought had meaning,

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,320
 every hope, dream, or moment of happiness,

15
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:44,619
 none of it matters as you lie bleeding out on the battlefield.

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:55,479
 None of it changes what a speeding rock does to a body. We all die. But does that mean our lives are meaningless?

17
00:00:55,479 --> 00:01:07,159
 Does that mean that there was no point in our being born? Would you say that of our slain comrades? What about their lives? Were they meaningless?

18
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:09,879
 They were not!

19
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:13,359
 Their memory serves as an example to us all!

20
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,560
 The courageous fallen, the anguished fallen!

21
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,760
 Their lives have meaning because we, the living, refuse to forget them!

22
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,000
 And as we ride to certain death, we trust our successors to do the same for us!

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Because my soldiers do not buckle or yield when faced with the cruelty of this world!

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:50,500
 My soldiers push forward! My soldiers scream out! My soldiers rage! Thanks for watching!
